# Prediction-by-linear-regression


# In this model, we will predict the GPA of two Students

Here prediction of GPA of two students named A and B respectively is done with the help of linear regression model defined in the previous repo.

Now we will make the prediction of the GPA of two students named:
Student A who scored 1700 in SAT but did not attended the 75 percent of lectures.
Student B who scored 1670 in SAT, moreover attended 75 percent of lectures.

Applying this model:
 The model has predicted the GPA of student A and student B to be 3.023513 and 3.204163 respectively
